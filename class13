# This took a bit of playing around with to get the syntax correct, and the paths.
# The user was added, how well their account is operationally is not clear at this time.
# I would recommend instead of doing one specifically for a user, create a powershell
# Script that would allow you to fill out the details in an excel spreadsheet and
# then have it bulk add users instead of manually putting in their information into
# this file and doing it one at a time.
